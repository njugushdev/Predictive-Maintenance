# Predictive-Maintenance
We develop a predictive model that predicts probability of failure of an electromechanical weighbridge
Downtime in weighbridge stations can cause losses from all aspects of an economy especially on roads.
Thus we utilize previous maintenance records obtained from a weighibg scales company to predict when maintenance is needed.
We also deploy the model on the web and feed it data to get a true/false output.
The alert is sent as a notification to the operator's phone triggering maintenance protocols.
